# NSLookupy

## Description:
NSlookupy is a Python script uses the core Python module and socket function for networking to resolve domain names and retrieve IPs linked to a given domain. The script takes as input a text file that contains a list of domains to be resolved, and outputs a text file including the hosts and IPs related to the domains listed.

## Requirements:

Python 3.x or later

## Usage:

- Ensure that the Python interpreter is installed on your system.
- Place the nslookup.py script and a text file that contains a list of domains to be resolved in the same directory.
- Open a command prompt or terminal window in the directory where the script and text file are located.
- Run the script with the following command:

	python3 nslookup.py sourcefile.txt

  (where 'sourcefile.txt' is the name of the file containing the list of domains)

## Output:

- The script outputs a text file called 'results.txt' that includes the hosts and IPs related to the domains listed in.
